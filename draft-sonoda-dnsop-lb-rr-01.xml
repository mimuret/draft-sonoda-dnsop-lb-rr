    <abstract>
      <t> This document defines a new DNS load balance function that is able to transfer information in zone transfer and not need online signing.
      DNS base load balance is popular technology. It provides weight base response and location base response.
      It have become an indispensable part of traffic engineering.
      However, DNS base load balance can't transfer load balance information in zone transfer and need online singing because it is not standardized.
      This document defines a new DNS resource record called "LB".
      LB RR provides the balancing information weight, location and target domain name.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <section title="Legacy DNS load balancing">
        <t>Legacy DNS load balancing provides traffic engineering.It use special authoritative name server.
        It response is one address record that is dynamic changes using network location and weight.
        It's used for large traffic WEB site domain name that is important domain name. Important domain name should be secure.</t>

        <t>But legacy DNS load balancing is not secure.
        Because Legacy DNS load balancing can't send zone data by zone transfer.
        It's mean very difficult to use multi service providers. That means weak for DDoS Attack.
        If zone is signed, All name servers require private key for dynamic signing because response is dynamic changes. 
        Distributing private key is not secure, It is increased risk of leakage private key.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="New DNS load balancing">
        <t>New DNS load balancing concept is that Authoritative name server uses "LB" RR to provide load balancing information
          and Clients application uses "LB" RR to select target name.
        </t>

        <t>"LB" RR defines load balancing settings that is network location and weight and target domain name.
          Network location is string that meaningful name of network. For example Country code (ex. JP),subdivision code(ex. US-CA) and Autonomous System Number (ex. AS65536).
          Weight is ratio value to use select target name. Target name is pointer to address record. </t>

        <t>"server.location" is special TXT record that is location information at full service resolver.
          Application can use this value for location selection. </t>

    <section title="The LB Resource Record">
      <t>The LB RR has mnemonic LB. LB RR define load balancing information.</t>
      <t>LB format below.</t>

      <t>The format is not class-sensitive.  All fields are required.</t>
      <t>&lt;weight&gt; field is a 2 octets, 1 or more natural number.</t>
      <t>&lt;location&gt; field is a "&lt;character-string&gt;"  <xref target="RFC1035"/>.</t>
