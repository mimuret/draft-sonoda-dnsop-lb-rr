Internet-Draft              Abbreviated Title               January 2018


1.  Introduction and Background

   This document defines a new DNS load balance function that is able to
   transfer information in zone transfer and not need online signing.

   DNS base load balance is popluer technology.  It provides weight base
   response and location base response.  It have become an indispensable
   part of traffic engineering.

   However, DNS base load balance can't transfer load balance
   information in zone transfer and need online sigining because it is
   not standardized.

   This document defines a new DNS resource record called "LB" and new
   EDNS option bit called "LS".  LB RR provides the balancing
   information wieght, location and target domain name.  LS bit provides
   the change response mechanism in name servers.

2.  Mechanism

   1.  Stub resolver sends A or AAAA query to full resolver.

   2.  Full Resolver sends A or AAAA query with LS bit to authoritative
   server.

   3.  Authoritative Server responses LB RRset.

   4.  Full Resolver selects target domaoin name using location
   information and weight information.

   5.  Full Resolver resolv target domaoin name.

   6.  Full Resolver response target domaoin name and LB RRSet to stub
   resolver.

3.  The LB Resource Record

   The LB RR has mnemonic LB.  LB RR define load balancing information.

   LB format below.

         <owner> <ttl> <class> LB <weight> <location> <target>

   The format is not class-sensitive.  All fields are required.

   <weight> field is a 2 octets, 1 or more natural number.

   <location> field is a "<character-string>"" [RFC1035].

   <target> field is a "<domain-name>"" [RFC1035].  It has A or AAAA RR
   or CNAME RR or DNAME RR.

3.1.  Define location

   <location> ::= "*" | <continental code> | <country code> |
   <subdivision code> | <asn code> | <private code>

   <continental code> ::= "AF" | "AN" | "AS" | "EU" | "NA" | "OC" | "SA"

   <country code> ::= ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 Country code.

   <subdivision code> ::= ISO 3166-2 Codes for the representation of
   names of countries and their subdivisions.

   <asn code> ::= "AS" <asn> [ ":" <asn>]

   <private code> ::= "+" <let>

   <ans> ::= <nonzero digit> <digit>

   <nonzero digit> ::= any one of the ten digits 1 through 9

   <digit> ::= any one of the ten digits 0 through 9

   <let> ::= any one of the 26 alphabetic characters A through Z in
   upper case or any one of the ten digits 0 through 9.

3.2.  Record example

   ; for any region.
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 * www.example.com.
   ; for AP region.
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 AP ap.example.com.
   ; for JP region, weight 1.
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 JP jp1.example.jp.
   ; for JP region, weight 3.
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 3 JP jp2.example.jp.
   ; for tokyo region. (JP-13 is tokyo region ISO 3166-2:JP)
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 JP-13 tokyo.example.jp.
   ; for AS2497
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 AS2496 as2497.example.jp.
   ; for AS2497
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 AS2496:1 as2497.example.jp.
   ; private use
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 +BEER beer.example.jp.

4.  The LB Support Flag

   Defines a new "EDNS Header Flags" [RFC6891] call LB Support Flag(LS)
   using full resolver sends LB RR supported to authoritative server.

   LS bit provides change response mechanism in authoritative name
   server.  If LS bit is flagged, Authoritative name server can response
   LB RR for A,AAAA query.

5.  Authoritative name server Behavior

   1.  If request query on EDNS Header LS bit then Authoritative name
   server special action before "4.3.2 3.a."" [RFC1034]

   2.  If QTYPE is A or B and a match between QNAME and LB RRset node
   name then copy all LB RRSet into the answer section and go to step
   "4.3.2 6" [RFC1034] . else go to step "4.2.3 3.a" [RFC1034].

   3.  If request query on EDNS Header LS bit then Authoritative name
   server SHOULD flagge LS bit in reply message.

5.1.  Example of authoritative name server behavior

   Example zone data:

   example.jp. 3600 IN SOA ( ns1.example.com.
                             postmaster.example.com.
                             1
                             3600
                             900
                             1814400
                             900 )
   example.jp. 3600 IN NS ns1.example.com.
   example.jp. 3600 IN NS ns2.example.com.
   example.jp. 3600 IN A 198.51.100.1
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 * www.example.com.
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 JP jp1.example.com.
   example.jp. 3600 IN LB 3 JP jp2.example.com.

   Incomming query with LS bit:

   query: qtype = example.jp. qtype=A, LS=1

   Response for include LS:

   query: qtype = example.jp. qtype=A
   response: LS=1
     answer:
       example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 * www.example.com.
       example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 JP jp1.example.com.
       example.jp. 3600 IN LB 3 JP jp2.example.com.
     authority:
       example.jp. 3600 IN NS ns1.example.com.
       example.jp. 3600 IN NS ns2.example.com.

   Incomming query without LS bit (normal query):

   query: qtype = example.jp. qtype=A, LS=0

   Response for not include LS:

   query: qtype = example.jp. qtype=A
   response:  LS=0
     answer:
           example.jp. 3600 IN A 198.51.100.1
     authority:
           example.jp. 3600 IN NS ns1.example.com.
           example.jp. 3600 IN NS ns2.example.com.

6.  Full Service Resolver Behavior

   1.  If Full resolver support LB RR, Full resolver send query to
   Authoritative Server with LS BIT.

   2.  If the responses shows a LB and that is now the answer itself,
   goto step 2.1 before "5.3.3 4" [RFC1034] else goto step "5.3.3 4"
   [RFC1034]

   3.  Select the target name from LB RR using weight and location.

   3.1.  First step, Exclude RR that's same value OWNER and target name.

   3.2.  Second step is location selection. location Selection needs
   location information.  Full Resolver default location is '*'.
   Location Information SHOULD gets from full resolver config.  MAY
   resolv location using stub resolver IP and GeoIP database.  The width
   of location decreases in order of ANY, code, Country code.  MUST
   select small area.  If RRSet not include RR that's location is '*',
   If can't select RR code.  Resolver MUST requery without LS bit.

   3.3.  Third step is weight selection.

   A Selection result MAY be cached.

6.1.  Example of Full Service Resolver Behavior

   1.  Full resolver's location is configured "JP-13 JP AS *".

   2.  Stub resolver query comming:

       query: qtype = example.jp. qtype=A

   3.  Full resolver send query:

       query: qtype = example.jp. qtype=A, LS=1

   3.  If response include LB:

       query: qtype = example.jp. qtype=A
       response: LS=1
         answer:
               example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 * www.example.com.
               example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 JP jp1.example.com.
               example.jp. 3600 IN LB 3 JP jp2.example.com.
         authority:
               example.jp. 3600 IN NS ns1.example.com.
               example.jp. 3600 IN NS ns2.example.com.

   4. select LB RR that's location include resolver location

               example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 JP jp1.example.com.
               example.jp. 3600 IN LB 3 JP jp2.example.com.

   5.  Select one LB RR using <weight>:

               example.jp. 3600 IN LB 3 JP jp2.example.com.

   5.  Name resolution <target>:

       query: qtype = jp2.example.com. qtype=A, LS=1
       response:
         answer:
               jp2.example.com. 3600 IN A 192.0.2.2
         authority:
               example.com. 3600 IN NS ns1.example.com.
               example.com. 3600 IN NS ns2.example.com.

   6.  Make response message:

       query: qtype = example.jp. qtype=A, LS=1
       response:
         answer:
               example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 * www.example.com.
               example.jp. 3600 IN LB 1 JP jp1.example.com.
               example.jp. 3600 IN LB 3 JP jp2.example.com.
               jp2.example.com. 3600 IN A 192.0.2.2
         authority:
               example.jp. 3600 IN NS ns1.example.com.
               example.jp. 3600 IN NS ns2.example.com.

   7.  Stub resolver uses 192.0.2.2

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a DNS RR data type value for the LB RR
   type under the "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" subregistry and a EDNS
   Header Flag value for the LB Support Flag under the "EDNS Header
   Flags (16 bits)" subregistry under the "Domain Name System (DNS)
   Parameters" registry.

8.  Security Considerations
